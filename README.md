# Freezing Statistical Analysis

This repository contains statistical analysis and associated data on freezing behavior, a critical component of my thesis research. Analysing freezing behavior offers insights into stress responses, learning, memory, and behavioral adaptation under varying conditions. This project specifically examines the effects of early life stress, as explored in [Brydges et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hipo.22259).

## TODO
- Package frequently-used data wrangling functions for more efficient use. Key functions already include Roxygen comments for easy documentation.
- Create an R Markdown file for generating reports, also perhaps a poster, pulling required functions and data from the package.
- Add a `renv` file for reproducible library imports (discovered `renv` after starting this project).
- Include unit testingâ€”currently no unit coverage :( .

## Features and Analyses
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring raw behavioral freezing count data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and initial insights to understand data distribution and characteristics.
- **Statistical Models (Inferential Analysis)**: ANOVAs and linear models to test hypotheses about freezing behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Line charts, bar plots, and error bars to illustrate findings.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files and figures generated by analysis scripts.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including experimental design (and a published thesis copy [TODO]).

## Preliminary Results
- Initial findings indicate that early life stress (ELS) effects are sex-specific.
