# Freezing Statistical Analysis
This repository contains statistical analysis and associated data on freezing behavior, a critical component of my thesis research. Freezing behavior analysis provides insights into stress responses, learning, memory, and behavioral adaptation under different conditions. This specific project aimed to examine the effects of early life stress, as seen in [Brydges et al. 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hipo.22259).

# TODO 
Make the data wrangling functions into a package for easier / more succinct use. 

## Features and Analyses
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring raw behavioural freezing count data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and initial insights to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- **Statistical Models (inferential analysis)**: Application of ANOVAs and linear models to test hypotheses about freezing behavior.
- **Data Visualization**: Line charts, bar plots, and error bars to illustrate findings.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: R and Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files and figures generated by the analysis scripts.
- `docs/`: Documentation files, including setup instructions and FAQs.

## Preliminary Results
- Results show that there are effects of ELS and these are sex specific.

## This Repo is possible due to the helpful colaboration of individuals within Hadyn Ellis Building, Cardiff.
