# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Overview

# 1. Data Overview and Structure
# - Load the data and review its structure (columns, data types, missing values).
# - Summarise categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Stress, Condition) and examine class distributions.
# - Identify continuous vs. categorical variables to guide the choice of visualisations.

# 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
# - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
# - Convert any columns to the appropriate data types (factors for categorical data).
# - Look for and address any potential outliers or inconsistencies in the data.

# 3. Univariate Analysis
# - Analyze each variable individually to understand distributions:
#   - For categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Stress, Condition), use bar plots or pie charts to show proportions.
#   - For continuous variables, create histograms or density plots to assess spread, skewness, and central tendency.

# 4. Bivariate Analysis
# - Explore relationships between pairs of variables:
#   - Use boxplots or violin plots to visualise the distribution of continuous variables across categories.
#   - Cross-tabulations and mosaic plots to show interactions between categorical variables.

# 5. Multivariate Analysis and Interactions
# - Investigate interactions between multiple variables:
#   - Use faceted plots to examine differences across combinations of variables, such as Sex and Stress on Condition.
#   - Pair plots or correlation plots (if there are multiple continuous variables) to identify relationships.

# 6. Initial Observations and Summary of Patterns
# - Record any patterns, clusters, or notable trends observed in the data.
# - Identify any unexpected findings or potential issues (e.g., large class imbalances, unusual outliers).

# 7. Next Steps and Preparation for Inferential Analysis CHeck for normality across the different variables.
# - Summarise key insights from the EDA that will guide the inferential analysis.
# - Document any decisions made during EDA (e.g., data cleaning steps, transformations applied).
# - Ensure that all insights align with the assumptions and design of your planned statistical tests.
